# Turing-Pulse-Expander
Rev 2 Turing Pulse Expander 

This is a slightly updated version of the Turing Machine Pulse Expander, with more outputs. It uses SMD components, but is still a very easy build. 

BOM: 

- 1 x 4081 Quad AND Gate, SO14 package 
- 11 x 3mm LEDs 
- 11 x 1k resistors, 1206 package 
- 11 x 2k resistors, 1206 package (These are the LED protection resistors, if you're using high intensity LEDs they should be a different value)
- 11 x [Thonkiconn](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/thonkiconn-3-5mm-jack-sockets-x50/) sockets
- 1 x 16 Pin Header 2x8 (for example 649-67997-216HLF from Mouser)
